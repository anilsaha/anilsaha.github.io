## Welcome to My Corner of the Tech World

I'm Anil Kumar Saha—an Indian citizen, Singapore PR, and a technologist who's spent more than 21 years at the intersection of finance and innovation.

### The Journey So Far

My career began in 2004 at IIT Kharagpur in India, where I built a Management Information System for pension schemes serving one million employees of an Indian coal company. It is where I learned how build software with right engineering practices and learn Java 1.4 first hand. Back than J2EE , JSP and EJB are the hot technologies and I was fortunate enough to learn by doing. One thing I cannot resist to tell you that , during that period I cleared SCJP (Sun Certified Java Programming) with 86%. Back then, Java was owned by Sun Microsystems. I was so proud of the SCJP - even I used to put that in my email signature along with my 86% score !!


**Citi Singapore (2005-2008)** – I moved to Singapore in 2025 and contributed in onboarding FX products onto OSCAR, a retail banking platform built on J2EE, leveraging Message Layer Interface and MQ technologies.

**UOB Singapore (2008)** – Led the design and development of One-Factor Authentication service for the bank's customer portal.

**Standard Chartered Bank (2008-2019)** – This is where I truly grew as a leader. Over 11 years, I progressed from Software Developer to Software Development Manager, tackling increasingly complex challenges:

- Built the **Scenarios Tool** for calculating PV and Greeks for trading books not supported by Murex and Sophis. The main highlight was using Adobe Flex to build Rick UI. Back then, there was no node , Angular or React.
- Developed **SABRE** (SCB Analytics, Booking & Risk Engine), creating the official EOD batch Consolidated Risk Tool serving Front Office, Middle Office, and Product Control users across 40 products and 64 reports. I improved performance by 50% through grid distribution strategy and job parallelism.
- Led **Basel III Liquidity Reporting (B3LR)** transformation, converting bash scripts into a unified Java/Control-M framework integrating 16+ systems across 19 countries with 100% test coverage. Implemented EU Regulation 575/2013, improving HQLA by $3B across key markets and expanding Fermat ALM coverage from 18 to 29 countries (84% to 99% balance sheet coverage).
- Managed **Counterparty Credit Risk** systems with a 15-developer team across 5 global sites, delivering 80+ product increments ($7.5M budget). Built IPDC pre-deal tracking using WebSocket, Spring Boot, OpenShift, and ReactJS while maintaining legacy systems like COCOA (10+ year-old Java Swing/OBIEE app) and Amadeus (7+ year-old Struts 1.3 app). Achieved **7x delivery improvement** in the first year of Agile implementation.

**DBS Bank (2019-Present)** – Currently serving as Senior Vice President and Engineering Lead, I oversee 140+ applications across enterprise risk, finance, legal, compliance, and audit functions, supporting 400+ developers and 200+ operations staff.

Here's are the few top items which keeps me busy:

- **Spearheading "Automated Everything"** – AI/ML and data-driven engineering solutions consistently delivered **3-4% annual cost reduction** through 10+ strategic automation and process optimization initiatives, and cut developer toil by **1+ hour per week** through modern SDLC tooling, engineering practices, AI, and automation.
- **Developer Productivity Innovation** – Created the proprietary **Know Your Developer (KYD)** analytics platform using Python, Java, and Angular, integrating 6+ SDLC tools to deliver actionable insights to 500+ engineering leads, saving S$1.5M in opportunity costs. This work led to **patent PCT/SG2023/050615** (published as WO2025058556) for a cross-functional team productivity measurement model.
- **Infrastructure Modernization** – Led hybrid cloud adoption: piloted 7 apps on AWS (EC2, Lambda, GPU, EMR) and modernized 42% of legacy infrastructure from traditional platforms (AIX, Solaris, WebSphere, DB2, Sybase) to cloud-optimized stacks (VM, MariaDB, JBoss, PCF, OpenShift)
- **Reliability Engineering** – Transformed reliability measurement from SLA to SLI, SLO, and Error Budget for 30% of applications, introducing Prometheus alongside existing ELK and Grafana stacks
- **CI/CD Standardization** – Standardized development, test, and release pipelines for multi-language (Java, Python, Node) and multi-infrastructure (VM, PCF, OCP, AWS) environments across 140+ applications, achieving 3x developer experience improvement
- **Software Asset Management** – Building tools by mining data from Nexus IQ and other SDLC tools to track EOS/EOL for libraries like Spring Boot, Angular, React, and Kafka


### What You'll Find Here

This blog is where I share what I've learned across two decades in financial services technology:

**AI & Developer Productivity** – Practical insights from building productivity measurement systems, implementing LLMs and agentic AI, and creating tools that measurably improve developer experience at enterprise scale. I'm particularly excited about **World Models**—what I believe is the next major innovation beyond LLMs and GPT. I'll be sharing my exploration of how these models that learn to simulate environments could transform financial services, from risk modeling to scenario analysis.

**Risk & Regulatory Technology** – Real stories from implementing Basel III across 29 countries, building counterparty credit risk systems, navigating BCBS 239 compliance, managing liquidity risk (LCR/NSFR), and dealing with the messy reality of regulatory requirements like EU Regulation 575/2013.

**Capital Markets Technology** – Lessons from building trading platforms, analytics engines, risk systems, and the infrastructure that powers them. From Murex integrations to building custom price engines.

**Engineering Transformation at Scale** – How to modernize legacy systems, implement hybrid cloud strategies, standardize CI/CD across diverse tech stacks, improve reliability through SRE practices, and transform delivery through Agile adoption.

**Leadership & Technology Management** – What I've learned managing distributed teams across multiple countries, leading multi-million dollar initiatives over multi-year periods, influencing without authority, and balancing technical excellence with business outcomes.

**Quantum Computing & the Future** – I'm diving deep into quantum computing and strongly believe it will fundamentally upend our entire technology ecosystem. From quantum algorithms that could revolutionize risk calculations and portfolio optimization to the security implications for financial systems, I'll share my learning journey and perspectives on how financial institutions should prepare for this paradigm shift.

**The Human Side of Tech** – Mentoring the next generation (I've worked with 6 SMU graduates and 5+ ITE students over 20+ sessions), evaluating innovation through DBS Foundation grants, and lessons from speaking at 20+ industry conferences.

### Why I Write

Technology in financial services is complex, heavily regulated, and high-stakes. The documentation is often dry. The war stories rarely get told. The messy middle—where most of us actually work—gets glossed over in favor of polished case studies.

But we're also at an inflection point. World Models are emerging as the next frontier beyond LLMs—systems that can simulate and reason about entire environments, not just generate text. Quantum computing is moving from theoretical promise to practical experimentation, with the potential to fundamentally reshape everything from cryptography to optimization problems that power financial markets.

I write because I believe we learn best from each other's experiences, especially the difficult ones. Some posts will be technical deep-dives into specific problems or emerging technologies. Others will explore strategic decisions and their consequences. Many will focus on the human challenges of technology leadership—building teams, managing change, and making trade-offs under pressure.

The views here are mine alone and don't represent any employer, past or present. I write for fellow technologists wrestling with similar challenges, business leaders considering AI adoption or digital transformation, and anyone curious about how technology reshapes financial services.

Thanks for being here. Let's learn together.
